# code analysis
scientific calculator app that uses the Tkinter module to create a graphical user interface and the math module to perform various 
mathematical operations. The app consists of a main window that displays the input and output, and a frame that contains buttons for 
digits, operators, and functions. The app defines several functions that insert, delete, clear, and evaluate the expression in the 
display, as well as some functions that calculate the factorial, sine, cosine, tangent, logarithm, square root, and power of a given 
number. The app uses the eval function to evaluate the expression in the display, and handles any exceptions that may occur. The app 
also uses lambda expressions to pass arguments to the functions when the buttons are clicked.

# The steps my code follows
- imports the Tkinter and math modules to create the graphical user interface and perform the mathematical operations.
- creates the main window and sets its title and size.
- creates the display entry and packs it with some padding.
- creates the buttons frame and packs it.
- defines the functions for the calculator, such as insert, delete, clear, evaluate, factorial, sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, and power.
- creates the buttons and assigns them the text, font, and command attributes.
- uses lambda expressions to pass arguments to the functions when the buttons are clicked.
- uses the eval function to evaluate the expression in the display and handles any exceptions that may occur.

# Uses of a scientific calculator 
The reason I made this project, because all the main operating systems of today, include a calculator app, but for 
some reason all the calculator apps, are not scientific, so I made a scientific calculator.
